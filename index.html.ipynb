    "# 1. Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer churn represents a significant cost to businesses — not only through lost revenue but also through the increased marketing expense to acquire new customers.This model helps mitigate churn by predicting which customers are at risk of \"churning\", which will be defined in this model as not purchasing over the next quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this information insight, marketing can automate targetted discount on products which the customer has previously purchase to improve retention rates. Additionally, the model estimates each customer’s expected spend over the same period, enhancing the ability to be cost efficient with the usage customer retention efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was built using transactional data from a UK-based e-commerce store and follows a two-stage regression approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Churn Prediction (Logistic Regression)**  \n",
    "   Estimates the probability of a customer churning within the next three months.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Future Spend Prediction (Linear Regression)**  \n",
    "   For customers predicted to remain active, forecasts their total spending over the same period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the model uses **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM)** features for its predictions. Future iterations will incorporate additional features following the initial deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging this model, the marketing team can better identify high-value customers at risk of churning and intervene to \"save\" them."
